# MBBS-Aboard-Form
Design Approach
The design was centered around simplicity, clarity, and user engagement. Since the website primarily serves students and their families looking for opportunities to study MBBS abroad, it had to look trustworthy and professional while maintaining a welcoming tone.

Clean, readable fonts were used to ensure accessibility across different devices.

User Experience (UX) Considerations:
The design ensures information is easy to find, with clearly structured sections.
The navigation is intuitive, allowing users to quickly explore different sections like “Why Study Abroad?”, “Top Destinations,” and FAQs.

Animations & Interactivity:
Framer Motion was used to add smooth transitions and animations, making interactions feel more dynamic.
A responsive design approach ensures the site works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
